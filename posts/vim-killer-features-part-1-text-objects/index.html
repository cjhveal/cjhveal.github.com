    <p>Vim has a notorious learning curve which often leads beginners to give up and
return to a more traditional editor or IDE. I tried to learn Vim many times
before I was able to fully embrace it, each time spending mountains of effort
simply trying to get to parity with my productivity in other editors. While
learning Vim will always require some frustration, a key insight is to find the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_feature">killer features</a> that no other
editor will provide you. This is part one in a series of posts about features
in Vim I couldn&#8217;t live without.</p>
<h3 id="imperative-vs-declarative-editing">Imperative vs. Declarative Editing</h3>
<p>Most common editors require navigating by mouse or keyboard to the end of a
block of text and backspacing character by character before typing some new
text.  While often there is a way to do this word by word, or for an entire line
(with modifier keys or multiple clicks in rapid succession) it is still a very
imperative paradigm. We must tell the editor how to manipulate the text at a low
level, instead of simply stating what we want done.</p>
<p>Vim&#8217;s modal paradigm instead works by providing us with a set of basic tools
that we can compose in a very declarative manner. Vim extends the set of
motions available to navigate around the file, for example <kbd>}</kbd> to move
the cursor by paragraphs and <kbd>f</kbd><kbd>x</kbd> to find the next
occurrence of the character &#8216;x&#8217;. <a href="http://naleid.com/">Ted Naleid</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LevelbossMike">Michael Klein</a>
have come up with a <a href="https://github.com/LevelbossMike/vim_shortcut_wallpaper">great reference wallpaper</a> for motions.</p>
<p>Vim also introduces operators which perform actions on blocks of text. For
instance <kbd>d</kbd> is used to delete text and <kbd>=</kbd> can automatically
correct indentation.  Composing operators and motions is simple to do and can
achieve powerful results.  For instance we can use <kbd>d</kbd><kbd>G</kbd> to
delete the rest of a file from our current line, or
<kbd>c</kbd><kbd>T</kbd><kbd>&#8220;</kbd> to change text up to, (but not including)
the previous double quote on the line. For more information see <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/motion.html#operator"><code>:help
operator</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>
<p>While it&#8217;s certainly useful to have many more options to navigate around the
file and perform actions on text, this method closely resembles the imperative
workflow of other editors since we still need to navigate to the start and end
of any region of text we wish to operate on.</p>
<p>To compound the problem, Vim movements are extremely unintuitive to the novice.
There are many ways to move from point a to b, and determining the most
efficient combination of keys to push requires understanding many movements and
committing them to muscle memory. Navigating to the precise start and end of text
blocks is not easy for Vim beginners, and even feels clumsy to all but seasoned
Vim experts.</p>
<h3 id="introducing-the-text-object">Introducing the Text Object</h3>
<p>Luckily, Vim allows us to specify a block of text in a more intuitive way. Plain
text is naturally broken up into words, sentences, and paragraphs. When
programming, pieces of text are often delimited by punctuation, like
<code>array[indices]</code>, <code>&quot;strings&quot;</code>, or <code>&lt;html&gt;tags&lt;/html&gt;</code>. We can reference text
that is grouped into logical chunks like this using Vim&#8217;s <em>text objects</em>. Any
operator that takes a motion will take a text object instead. This lets us avoid
having to navigate to the start and end of regions, we simply need to move the
cursor <em>anywhere</em> within the region.</p>
<p>All text objects come in two forms, normal and inner (prefixed by <kbd>a</kbd>
and <kbd>i</kbd>, respectively). As a general rule, normal text objects include
the characters that delimit the object, while the inner form will leave the
delimiters intact.  The normal form is often used when deleting an object and
the inner form is often useful for changing an object. For example,
<kbd>d</kbd><kbd>a</kbd><kbd>&#8220;</kbd> will delete a double quoted string
(perhaps to replace it with a variable), while
<kbd>c</kbd><kbd>i</kbd><kbd>&#8220;</kbd> will leave the quotes intact, and only
delete the content inside the string, ready to be altered.</p>
<h3 id="built-in-text-objects">Built-in Text Objects</h3>
<p>Vim comes bundled with a number of text objects defined. I&#8217;ve listed them below,
but you can get more detailed descriptions of them by viewing <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/motion.html#text-objects"><code>:help text-objects</code></a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Word by punctuation: <kbd>a</kbd><kbd>w</kbd>/<kbd>i</kbd><kbd>w</kbd></li>
<li>Word by whitespace: <kbd>a</kbd><kbd>W</kbd>/<kbd>i</kbd><kbd>W</kbd> (see <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/motion.html#WORD"><code>:help WORD</code></a>)</li>
<li>Sentence: <kbd>a</kbd><kbd>s</kbd>/<kbd>i</kbd><kbd>s</kbd></li>
<li>Paragraph: <kbd>a</kbd><kbd>p</kbd>/<kbd>i</kbd><kbd>p</kbd></li>
<li>Quotes: <kbd>a</kbd><kbd>&#8220;</kbd>/<kbd>i</kbd><kbd>&#8220;</kbd></li>
<li>Parentheses: <kbd>a</kbd><kbd>)</kbd>/<kbd>i</kbd><kbd>)</kbd></li>
<li>Brackets: <kbd>a</kbd><kbd>]</kbd>/<kbd>i</kbd><kbd>]</kbd></li>
<li>Braces: <kbd>a</kbd><kbd>}</kbd>/<kbd>i</kbd><kbd>}</kbd></li>
<li>Angle Brackets: <kbd>a</kbd><kbd>></kbd>/<kbd>i</kbd><kbd>></kbd></li>
<li>Tags (e.g. <code>&lt;html&gt;inner&lt;/html&gt;</code>): <kbd>a</kbd><kbd>t</kbd>/<kbd>i</kbd><kbd>t</kbd></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="user-text-objects">User Text Objects</h3>
<p>There are also a number of useful plugins which extend Vim&#8217;s built-in pool of
text objects to power some very useful workflows.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vim-scripts/argtextobj.vim">ArgTextObj</a></p>
<p>Adds an object for arguments lists of the form <code>(arg1, arg2, arg3)</code>,
where <code>ia</code> will target an argument and <code>aa</code> will include the comma if
present.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-entire">vim-textobj-entire</a></p>
<p>Gives us an object to refer to the entire buffer. This is useful to
replace the <code>gg&lt;command&gt;G</code> idiom. For example, to format the entire buffer
use <code>=ae</code>, or to start fresh use <code>dae</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2484">vim-textobj-indent</a></p>
<p>Allows us to select lines based on their indentation. Useful in languages
with syntactically significant whitespace like python or coffeescript.
<code>ii</code> targets all contiguous lines with the same or deeper indentation, while <code>ai</code> does the
same while skipping over whitespace. The <code>aI</code> and <code>iI</code> variants are similar,
but only select lines with the <em>same</em> level of indentation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/mattn/vim-textobj-url">vim-textobj-url</a></p>
<p>Adds support for URLs with the <code>au</code>/<code>iu</code> text object.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/thinca/vim-textobj-comment">vim-textobj-comment</a></p>
<p>With this plugin, we can target text inside multi-line and single line
comments, with <code>ac</code> including the comment tokens (<code>//</code> or <code>/* */</code>) and <code>ic</code>
operating inside.</p>
</li>
</ul>
